## Repository for "The metazoan landscape of mitochondrial DNA gene order and content is shaped by selection and affects mitochondrial transcription" by Noam Shtolz and Dan Mishmar
This code contains 4 main parts:

- Database construction.
- Gene content analysis. 
- Gene order analysis.
- Poly-cistrone detection using transcriptomic data (RNA-seq and PRO-seq).

### Background
This repository contains all the code used for the results presented in the paper `link here`.
In the paper, we study and compare the mitochondrial gene order and contents of over 8,000 available metazoan oragnisms. We then analyzed available RNA-seq data of 56 different metazoans to disover the polycistronic organization of a variaty of mtDNAs based on intergenic junction expression patterns.
